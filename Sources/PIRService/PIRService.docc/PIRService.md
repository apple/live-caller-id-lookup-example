Example service for Live Caller ID Lookup

## Overview

[Live Caller ID
Lookup](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sms_and_call_reporting/getting_up-to-date_calling_and_blocking_information_for_your_app)
is a new feature that allows the system to communicate with a third party service to privately retrieve information
about a phone number when an incoming call is coming in. This allows the system to automatically block known spam
callers and display identity information on the incoming call screen.

This service is an non-scalable example that can be used to test the Live Caller ID Lookup feature.
